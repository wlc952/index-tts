# üëâüèª IndexTTS-TPUüëàüèª

**IndexTTS** is a GPT-style text-to-speech (TTS) model mainly based on XTTS and Tortoise. It is capable of correcting the pronunciation of Chinese characters using pinyin and controlling pauses at any position through punctuation marks. We enhanced multiple modules of the system, including the improvement of speaker condition feature representation, and the integration of BigVGAN2 to optimize audio quality. Trained on tens of thousands of hours of data, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming current popular TTS systems such as XTTS, CosyVoice2, Fish-Speech, and F5-TTS.

**IndexTTS-TPU** is an optimized inference implementation of **IndexTTS** designed for SOPHGO BM1684X TPU hardware acceleration.
